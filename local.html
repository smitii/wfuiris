<h1 class="pageName2">Directions to Providence from Boston Logan</h1>
<ul class="bodyText">
<li> MBTA Commuter Rail (train) 
<ul><li>From your arrival terminal at Boston Logan, follow the signs to the Silver Line bus. Once at the stop, board the bus for free and get off at the last stop, which is South Station, a hub for transportation in Boston. Follow the directions to Commuter Rail, and check the train schedule <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU">here</a> (make sure you sort by Outbound and either weekday or Saturday/Sunday depending on when youï¿½re traveling). You can buy your tickets at the Commuter rail counters for $10.5 (one way), or on the train for $13. The trip takes about an hour and 10 minutes. Once at the Providence train station, the Hampton Inn is a 10 minute walk away, or there are cabs parked in front of the station (as well as the taxi options outlined above).</li></ul></li>
<li> Amtrak (train) 
<ul><li>Follow the same directions as for the MBTA Commuter Rail to get to South Station. Look up the train schedule from Boston South Station to Providence <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/home">here</a>, and get your ticket at the Amtrak ticket counter (or in advance from their website). The Amtrak will take you to the same train station in Providence as the commuter rail, but is a bit more expensive.</li></ul></li>
<li> Peter Pan bus 
<ul><li>The bus leaves from directly in front of each terminal. You can check the schedule and reserve a ticket <a href="http://peterpanbus.com/">here</a>. A one-way ticket is about $20, and it leaves you at the Providence Downtown Station (Kennedy Plaza Transportation System), which is a 5 minute walk from the Hampton Inn.</li></ul></li>
<li> Driving
<ul><li>Driving times can vary between 1 and 2 hours depending on traffic in Boston; directions are available <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Boston+Logan+International+Airport,+Harborside+Drive,+Boston,+MA/Hampton+Inn+%26+Suites+Providence+Downtown,+Weybosset+Street,+Providence,+RI/@42.0479207,-71.5103454,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37014d5da4937:0xc9394c31f2d5144!2m2!1d-71.00956!2d42.365613!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e445142a1f02a9:0x9bef8ee37486c664!2m2!1d-71.409601!2d41.823812!3e0">here</a>.
